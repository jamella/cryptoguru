# cryptoguru
A python package containing efficient attacks on well-known crypto algorithms (RSA, DLP) and some factoring tools.
This package is mainly intended for educational purposes, as a state-of-the-art overview of existing attacks on pre-quantic crypto algorithms.

This package is a beta version for the moment, some parts of the code and all comments are still in french. We are currently working on building a decent documentation for the package and improving some of the algorithms.
