# cryptoguru
A python package containing efficient attacks on well-known crypto algorithms (RSA, DLP) and some factoring tools.
This package is mainly intended for educational purposes, as a state-of-the-art overview of existing attacks on pre-quantic crypto algorithms.

This package is a beta version for the moment.
There's a beautiful HTML doc in english in doc/build/ !
We are currently working on imporving some of the algorithms, that's why some comments are still in french.
